### What is`T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM`?

Its the scope resolution operator \(double colon :: \).

In PHP, the scope resolution operator is also called Paamayim Nekudotayim \(Hebrew: פעמיים נקודתיים‎‎, pronounced \[paʔaˈmajim nəkudaˈtajim\]\), which means “twice colon” in Hebrew.

The name "Paamayim Nekudotayim" was introduced in the Israeli-developed Zend Engine 0.5 used in PHP 3. Although it has been confusing to many developers who do not speak Hebrew, it is still being used in PHP 7, as in this sample error message:

```
$ php -r ::
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM
```
